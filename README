* MyHTTPd is a projcet about building a server that request web pages.       *
* The project deal with parsing basic request in http (GET/POST)             *
* We have to handle lots of simultaneous connexions thanks to threads.       *
*                                                                            * 
* We use curl to generate request, and TOML which is a custom library,       *
* to parse the given server configuration.                                   *
*                                                                            *
